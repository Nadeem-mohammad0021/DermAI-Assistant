## 🚀 Features

- 🔬 **AI-Powered Skin Disease Detection** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- 📷 **Image Upload & Capture** support for affected skin areas
- 📊 **Personalized Treatment & Prevention Recommendations**
- 🧠 **Offline-Ready Model** – No external API dependencies
- 🔐 **User Privacy Focused** – Local processing only
- 🌐 **Mobile-Responsive Web UI**
- 🛠️ **Lightweight & Real-World Ready**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **ML/DL:** TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV
- **Model:** Custom-trained CNN for multi-class skin condition classification
- **Storage (optional):** SQLite or Local JSON

---

## 📷 How It Works

1. User uploads or captures a photo of the skin condition.
2. Image is preprocessed and passed into the trained CNN model.
3. Model returns the predicted skin condition.
4. Based on prediction, treatment & prevention steps are displayed.
